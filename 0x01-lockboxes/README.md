# Lockboxes Problem

## Problem Description

You are faced with a coding challenge known as the "lockboxes problem." The problem involves a series of locked boxes, each numbered sequentially from 0 to n-1. Each box contains keys that may open other boxes, following specific rules:

1. A key with the same number as the box can open that specific box.
2. There may be keys that do not correspond to any boxes.
3. A box may be empty, meaning it does not contain any keys.

The task is to write a function or algorithm that determines whether it is possible to unlock all the boxes, starting from an initially unlocked box.

## Function Prototype

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether all the boxes can be opened based on the provided set of boxes.

    Parameters:
    - boxes: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a box and contains integers representing keys.

    Returns:
    - True if all boxes can be opened, False otherwise.
